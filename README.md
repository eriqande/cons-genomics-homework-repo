# cons-genomics-homework-repo

This is a directory with a few tiny pieces of genomic
data in standard formats.

It serves as the basis for some of the homework assignments in BZ 581A2.

Eric will keep building upon this repository and adding more assignments
as the semester progresses.  

For any particular assignment, your work should be done in a _branch_.  

You should reserve the `main` branch for pulling in from `upstream`.
We will discuss what this means as the semester progresses.
